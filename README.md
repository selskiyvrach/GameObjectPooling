Overview
  
      GameObject pooling system for prototypes
  
Features
    
      It's a pretty simple pooling system consisting from one 100-line class (and two small sidekicks for local purposes)
      Creates a pool of clones of requested gameObject
      Keeps hierarchy clean
      Has some protection from common MonoBehaviour related fuckups
